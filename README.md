## Problem Statement of GGI

- Make a responsive web application that consumes an API and lists the data in a user- friendly interface. The application should also have a form to take user input, validate it and send data via a POST request.

- Since this is a full-stack role, developing and using your own API/backend is a bonus but using a 3rd party API is ok too.

- Bonus - Implement advanced React features like routing, server-side rendering(Next.js). You can also use Ul frameworks like Material Ul and Ant Ul.
